- gracefully handle discord.js socket errors
- stop plugin intervals when reloading
- run commands by @ing the bot
- better persistence (sqlite?)
- lil library for the repl (easy to send messages, plugin management?)
- API key management
  - does this need to be separate from general persistence?
- remove plugin if file is deleted
- db.remove
